# Hi there, I'm Gleb ðŸ‘‹

I've been working as a Tech Lead Engineer for a while now and love helping others in the Frontend development area. 

I've been in this field for about 16 years, working worldwide on different kinds of projects. My main goal has always been to make web products that are easy to use, fast, and designed with the user in mind. I believe in creating not just tools, but experiences that make people's lives better.

I love to help people to become developers regardless of their background, previous job, and skills. I enjoy patiently explaining complex topics in plain language like you're five. Whether you're catching up on a pet project or nailing a bug, reach out and we can do it together.

Please let me know if you feel you need help with the following topics:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Kotlin
- Python
- SQL
- React
- ReactNative
- GraphQL

ðŸŒ± At the moment I'm learning  LLMs, especially how they can make apps smarter and more user-friendly.
